I am currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence, with the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems (IRAIS), [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), Tianjin, China, and also with the Institute of Intelligence Technology and Robotic Systems, [Shenzhen Research Institute of Nankai University](https://nkszri.nankai.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Ning Sun（孙宁）at the [Underactuated Robots Lab](https://url.nankai.edu.cn/). Previously I received the B.S. degree in automation from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), Changchun, China, in 2021.

**Research Interests:** <span style="color: red;">My research focuses on underactuated robotic systems and suspended micro-low gravity simulation systems.</span> I am particularly interested in developing innovative planning and nonlinear/intelligent control strategies to address the challenges posed by underactuation, such as limited control inputs and complex dynamics. Additionally, I work on suspended systems that simulate micro-low gravity environments, enabling the testing and validation of space robotics and other applications in a controlled setting. My goal is to advance the capabilities of these systems through robust and efficient algorithms that enhance their performance, adaptability, intelligence, and autonomy.

I am leading an NSFC Youth Student Research Project (for PhD students) / 国家自然科学基金青年学生基础研究项目（博士生项目）entitled "Research on Variable Tension and Follow-Up Control of Suspension Systems Under Micro-Low Gravity Simulation Scenario".

**Future Opportunities:** I am open to potential academic and industry job opportunities following my graduation in June 2026. You can find my Business Card from [Business Card](../files/Business_Card.jpg), and download my Chinese resume from [中文简历](../files/翟猛-个人简历.pdf). Please feel free to contact me.
