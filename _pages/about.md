I am currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence, with the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems (IRAIS), [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), Tianjin, China, and also with the Institute of Intelligence Technology and Robotic Systems, [Shenzhen Research Institute of Nankai University](https://nkszri.nankai.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Ning Sun（孙宁）at the [Underactuated Robots Lab](https://url.nankai.edu.cn/). Previously I received the B.S. degree in Automation from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), Changchun, China, in 2021.

**Research Interests:** <span style="color: red;">My research focuses on underactuated mechatronic/robotic systems and suspended micro-low gravity simulation systems, with equal emphasis on theory and application.</span> I am particularly interested in developing innovative planning and nonlinear/intelligent control strategies to address the challenges posed by robots with underactuation (fewer independent control inputs than system degrees of freedom) and complex dynamics. Additionally, I work on suspended systems that simulate micro-low gravity environments, enabling the testing and validation of space robotics and other applications in a controlled setting. My goal is to advance the capabilities of these systems through efficient and robust algorithms that enhance their performance, adaptability, intelligence, and autonomy.

I am leading an NSFC Youth Student Basic Research Project (for Ph.D. students) / 国家自然科学基金青年学生基础研究项目（博士生项目）entitled "Research on Variable Tension and Follow-Up Control of Suspension Systems Under Micro-Low Gravity Simulation Scenario".

**Future Opportunities:** I am open to potential academic and industry job opportunities following my graduation in June 2026. You can find my Business Card from [Business Card](../files/Business_Card.jpg), and download my Chinese resume from [中文简历](../files/【教职】翟猛-个人简历（2025.05.12）.pdf). Please feel free to contact me.
